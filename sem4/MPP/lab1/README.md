# Lab 1 assignment

**Points**: 1

**Deadline**: Week 2

**Last chance deadline and penalties**: Week 4, -0.3 points / week delayed

----

Choose any programming language and a **backend** framework and setup a development environment in it. Create an application with CRUD functionalities for a single entity of your choice. The entity should have at least 5 attributes, not counting the ID. You do not need any validations.

Remarks:
- Your application should either expose a REST API (like Django REST Framework, Flask) or a webpage that can be accessed in the browser (like Django)
- Console apps are **not** allowed
- Frontend frameworks / libraries (React, Angular) are **not** allowed
- You should be able to explain basic things about your framework of choice (where routes are defined, how the models are handled etc.) 
- You will also be marked on good coding practices and design principles, as they have been taught in Fundamentals of Programming and Object Oriented Programming and as they apply to your choice of framework

Suggestions:
- You can probably find libraries in your favorite language that help you build Web applications and REST APIs
- I suggest you make a REST API, as that will become mandatory later on anyway
- Java has Spring, Python has Django, C# has WebApi etc. The keywords to search for are your language + rest api
- Make sure you get comfortable with reading your choice's documentation and that you pick something with an active community, as you will be spending a lot of time studying stuff on your own

For this and all future assignments, unless otherwise specified, we are no longer treating the backend and the frontend separately when talking about features: implementing most features will require you to work on both the backend and the frontend, even if this is not explicitly stated.

You will need to:

Implement all functionalities on the frontend. Implement pagination on the backend and navigation through it on the frontend. You are not allowed to only use built-in pagination classes and pagination libraries. You must implement the pagination class or functionality yourself either on the frontend or on the backend. Do it in a way that allows for changes. For example, you may use built-in classes on the backend and no built-in classes on the frontend. Your live coding task during the lab will involve the pagination aspect. Recall that you should have at least the following from previous assignments and live tasks:
3 entities.
1 intermediate entity for a many to many relation, whose CRUDs can be handled either through dedicated routes or through the other entities' routes.
3 validation rules.
1 filter by a numerical field.
2 statistical reports.
Make sure that your functionalities have efficient implementations. This may require adding indexes to your database, implementing autocomplete and fixing things on the backend. There shouldn't be a noticeable slowdown when interacting with any page.
Each show all page should display, for each row, an aggregated value on a related entity (for example, the number of students enrolled in the course for the show all courses page). This should still be efficient and not affect page load times too much.
Duplicate your validation logic on the frontend and add 2 more validation rules, also duplicated on the backend and the frontend.
Error messages should show up on the frontend near the corresponding textboxes or using Toasters.
If you haven't already, add a CSS Components Library to your frontend: Material UI, Bulma, Bootstrap, Tailwind or something similar.
Secure and improve your server by:
Installing nginx and a dedicated application server for your backend. The nginx reverse proxy server should communicate with your application server and the application server should not be directly exposed to the internet. The application server can be Gunicorn, Apache, Tomcat or something else. For .NET projects, you can just use IIS or the default deployment scheme. If you do not do it this way then you must have a very compelling reason that you can explain with your tech stack's documentation as support.
Installing an SSL certificate using something like certbot or acmesh and freedns. Since your VM IP will change if you shut down your VM, I recommend starting and configuring it well in advance of your lab, to account for any possible delays with the DNS propagation. Everything should now use https. Make sure you update your frontend accordingly.
Making both nginx and your application server services that start when your VM starts and that you control with commands such as sudo systemctl start nginx, sudo systemctl start your_app_server. You might be asked to show this by restarting your VM.
Lab 6 assignment
Points: 0.3, 0.3 Bonus

This assignment, as well as all future ones, must be completed on your deployed applications.

You will need to:

Use an actual database server: I recommend PostgreSQL (and MS SQL for .NET projects), but MySQL or NoSQL databases are also accepted. No embedded databases are accepted. Please do not attempt this assignment with SQLite, embedded H2 or anything similar as it will not be accepted.
Populate your database with at least 1 000 000 (one million) records for each entity. Add 10 000 000 (ten million) records for the entity acting as an intermediary in the many to many relation. This should be done through SQL scripts (one or more files) that you execute outside of your application. The data should be realistic looking: don't add complete gibberish, don't add exclusively the same value for any of the attributes, don't add sequential data where it doesn't make sense etc. It's ok if there is some repetition in the data, outside of unique fields. You can use a service such as https://www.onlinedatagenerator.com/ to help you out, but you might need some manual fine-tuning. The script should execute in a reasonable amount of time. Some ideas and suggestions below:
The data doesn't need to be 100% realistic. You can have a few unique values that you randomly repeat across the many records and that you concatenate things like "_1", "_2" etc. to. If they don't need to be unique values, you don't even have to concatenate anything to them. For non-unique attributes, you actually want some amount of repetition.
You can generate random values for things such as age, year etc.
The SQL script can have logic such as loops in it.
Although the end result needs to be at least one SQL script, you can use an external program (such as a Python script) that generates the SQL file by writing stuff in it. It might be easier to have things like lists that store base values in Python / other languages compared to pure SQL. Consider using the Faker library for this: https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/.
You might want to batch the inserts to make things faster: INSERT INTO tbl_name (a, b, c) VALUES (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9);. Batches of size 1000 generally work pretty well.
For the many to many intermediate table, make sure that you don't repeat the same pair of related IDs (unless this makes sense in your particular case).
Start using migrations if you haven't already: rerunning the application or changing something in your data models should not drop and recreate the database.
This amount of data will likely break many things in your application, especially the read all functionalities. You don't have to fix this yet, but 0.3 points are available as a bonus if you attempt to optimize and fix things by week 7. You will present this assignment by running queries and by showing your SQL files and any scripts that generated them.
Just like the previous assignments, this one will also have a live coding part during the lab. Try to come up with a robust solution that you can easily adapt to any requested changes or enhancements.

Lab 5 assignment

Deadline: Week 6

You will need to:

Add a frontend to your REST API. It should be a Single Page Application (SPA). You can choose any frontend framework or library that lets you create SPAs: React, Angular, Vue etc. It should be something that is under active development.
Add Swagger to your REST API. It should be publicly accessible.
Implement at least one CRUD and one filter / statististical report on the frontend.
Users should be able to navigate the interface without manually editing the URL. The interface should also be intuitive and self-explanatory: if you need to explain it to your lab teacher, it's not good enough.
Deploy the frontend either on https://www.netlify.com/ (or equivalent) or on your virtual machine. If you choose netlify or equivalent, it should deploy automatically when you commit to github.
Try to make it look nice and user friendly by adding a UI Components Library like Material UI, Bulma, or even something like Bootstrap, Tailwind etc. This is optional for now, but it will be required later, and you will save time in the long run if you start doing it from the beginning.
